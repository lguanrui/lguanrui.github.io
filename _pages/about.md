My name is Guanrui Li（李冠睿）, pronounced as "Guan(冠) Ray(睿) Li(李)". You can call me Rui(Ray) for short. Currently I am a PhD student of the ECE department at Tandon school of Engineering, New York University, supervised by [Prof. Giuseppe Loianno](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/giuseppe-loianno), Principle Investigator of [Agile Robotics and Perception Lab(ARPL)](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) at the New York University. 

I was an undergraduate in Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU), Guangzhou, China. It is one of the top ten universities in China. My major was Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. 

After four-year-undergraduate study in Mechanics, I found myself passionate at dynamics and building things. Hence I chose to pursue a master degree of Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania. During my master, I participated in research at the GRASP Lab, supervised by Prof. Vijay Kumar and Prof. Mark Yim. 

After graduating from UPenn, I stayed working as a full time research assistant in the ModLab, supervised by Prof. Mark Yim for half an year. Then I moved to Pittsburgh working as a full time research staff for half a year in the AirLab at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, supervised by Prof. Sebastian Scherer.  


In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis and having good food (as you might be able to tell from the photo...).
